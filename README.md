# CHIP8-GM
A Chip8 / Superchip8 emulator for Windows made in GameMaker v2023.6

Instructions:
Run the game in the editor or export it as as executable.
This emulator uses keyboard only, Press F1 to see the various keys.
F2 opens a file open dialog, navigate to a ROM file (.ch8) in your PC.

Only tested on Windows, will not be supporting any other platform.
This emulator is compatible with CHIP-8 / SUPERCHIP-8 programs.
ROM files are not included, I provided a link below with some public domain ones
that are free to download.
This is only my interpretation so it might not be 100% accurate.

What is CHIP-8?
CHIP-8 is an old VM made somewhere in 1970s.
It had many versions/ports along the years from home computers to even some calculators.
This is an interpreter of CHIP-8 made in GameMaker Studio 2. 

Why in GameMaker? Surely there are better ways to make an emulator?!
Of course there are, but this was made purely for educational purposes and my own amusement.

Personal Note:
This was really fun to make, and aside from some really hard to spot bugs 
it went pretty smoothly.
It's my first time making an emulator of any kind and so i've learned a lot from it,
Specifically about memory, buffers, binary and how to debug your code properly.
I feel ready to pick up some new challenge, maybe a gameboy emulator in GameMaker?
If this got you interested in making your own emulator i highly suggest it!
